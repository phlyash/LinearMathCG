To work with vectors you need to know that every vector is inherited from
`AbstractVector` and has next methods:
* `multiply(float num)` multiplies current instance of vector on given number
* `divide(float num) throws ArithmeticException` divides current instance of vector on given number
* `normalize` normalizes current instance of vector
*
